04/12 -  There was a request for the crossbar of the dome to be isolated and uploaded as way to retrofit printed domes.  I uploaded the piece and it should slip into place if inserted from the bottom.  The orientation doesn't matter.  I can almost gaurantee that this method will require some tweaking of the height spacer. This can be done by scaling in your slicer program or modifying in a CAD program.  Just as a disclaimer, I have never created a dome in the manner, so I can't vouch for the results. Good Luck.
